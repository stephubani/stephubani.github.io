##How I created my website
1. I created a GitHub account
2. I forked a repository from https://github.com/datamaunz
3. I renamed the forked repository tea-berlin.github.io
4. I edited the files as described in the README.md
5. Now I am writing my first post by following the advice that I got from the README file
